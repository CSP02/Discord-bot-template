This folder is for the while which handles the interactions other than slash commands.
Like interactions from menus and buttons

If you are coding an interaction to your command(remember these files are only for interactions other than slash commands)
define a property called interactTo: "you file name" in the file you are saving here

example if i want to code the interaction to the selected menu option for the help command:
I can do something like this:

module.exports = {
    interactTo: "help",
    ......

    async execute(){
        .....
    }
}

Remember that the command name should match interactTo property in here.
